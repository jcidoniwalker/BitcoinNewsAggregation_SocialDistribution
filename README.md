# BitcoinNewsAggregation_SocialDistribution
A base for aggregating news articles and announcing them via social media

Although intended as a base, this script specifically retrieves data on various articles listed on: https://www.ccn.com/news/ 
and announces them on a specified Twitter account via Twitterâ€™s API. If the article has already been posted to your Twitter 
(e.g. you run the script twice seconds apart), it will not re-post (yay)!

To use this script with the given example (articles from CCN): 
-> Enter your MySQL credentials (Database > database.class.php)
-> Import the "db.sql" file included
-> Set your Twitter API keys (Social > social.class.php)
-> Run!

I will not support this script in any fashion from this point on! This is a phenomenal base! Use it effectively!

Enjoy!
